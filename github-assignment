I took a look at WNYC's GitHub page and found a tool called tik-tok. tik-tok is a mobile-friendly timeline tool that was built with JavaScript. 
My first thought is that I'm a little overwhelmed by the amount of things happening in the repository, but I guess that's to be expected. Anyway, I chose this repository because it seems like a practical newsroom tool. There are a lot of individual files and a few folders, so I guess it would be good to understand how developers package and organize things within their repositories. 
Now it'd be cool to see some ways that this repository has been used to do journalism! Can you link to that kind of thing on Git Hub? Do people do that? But if you could see the thing you're working toward as you're working toward it, I think that'd be cool. 
I think the other question I have is if I knew how to assemble the moving parts of this repository, how much more time would it take for me to make an actual piece of journalism? 
Also, how long did it take the WNYC folks to put this together? Either way, it is cool! 
Fianlly, apologies that this is late! Getting back on top of things after ONA took a minute. I am still a bit confused on how to add a file from my local machine to my Github repository, but I haven't seen last Wednesday's class yet.
